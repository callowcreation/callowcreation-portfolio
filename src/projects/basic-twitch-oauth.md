Intended to reduce the expected prerequisite experience required for implementing Twitch OAuth to use the Twitch API(s)

**Motivation**
The statements below are still a bit beyond your experiences and you need/want to use a Twitch APIâ€¦ is my motivation.

Twitch API(s) now require that some endpoint request must have an authorization in the header. To acquire an access token for a Twitch API you must be familiar with an authentication flow. The flows supported by Twitch are Implicit code, authorization code, and client credentials.
