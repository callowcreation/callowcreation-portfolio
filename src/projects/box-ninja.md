**Box Ninja**
### We will cover advanced Unity & C# topics.

In lesson 1 we cover the setup of the character controller, by lesson 2, we’re covering abstract class inheritance, and encapsulation. As you can see, we’re accelerating through advanced topics very early.

In lesson 7, we cover how to use the ScriptableObject class & editor scripting to embed a level editor into the development environment. We also cover practical uses of lambda expressions, delegates and events. We’ll implement cross platform input for jump & movement covered in lesson 3.
