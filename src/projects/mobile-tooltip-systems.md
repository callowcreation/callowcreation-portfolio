**Mobile Tooltip Systems** uses Unity’s Event System to track touches/clicks long press and long click to show a popup tool-tip style message overlaying the screen. The system offers additional functionality for Standalone builds with a Hover to show the tool-tip.

Providing a consistent Unity Editor experience with custom property drawers to maintain familiar interface which allows the entire development team to use it. The accompanying API is designed to be extensible and flexible so your specific needs can be implemented.

The asset contains prefabs for all required items so your experience will be consistent with Unity’s workflow. Using these prefabs to get a working tool-tip system requires NO coding. There are, nonetheless, scripts provided as usable examples to roll your own tool-tip system.

The tool-tip system uses an animator with two animations, one for showing/hiding and another for destroying the tool-tip. These animations are standard Unity animations and animator controller and can be changed to fit your different projects.

Creating your own components can be done by inheriting from TooltipSystems.Core namespace.
