Hi, I am Jones based in California, USA. As a kid I didn’t play with the toys my parents gave me, well not whole at least.  Someone would have thought I just like to break things and I did, my toys specifically to see what made them tick.

I have always loved programming from my first experience in the 9th grade when my father brought home a brand new Commodore 64.  So a few years ago, over 10 now, I made a career change from management at a travel trailer company to becoming a professional software developer.

These days I pride myself on being an outstanding developer, who believes in achieving a goal as efficiently as possible.  I enjoy solving problems as my hobbies, designing and building electronic circuits, and computer programming may imply also I am a self-published poet; creating things is so much fun. I want to learn as much as I can while I’m alive and teach it.  This attitude translates into my job performance.

I am a Detail-oriented, organized, and meticulous engineer with over 10 years of experience in professional software development, delivering products to customers and end-users.
