## *"Testimonials"*

**Bitcorn Project**

Jones led the effort to build our Twitch bot Bitcorn integration which allows users to transfer Bitcorn with Twitch chat commands and a Twitch Extension for users to see and check their Bitcorn status.  

**Trip Time Games**

Jones was hired to build out our internal development toolset for Unity to streamline our development process. Along with making significant contributions to our overall build quality the custom tooling has allowed us to rapidly iterate through design and development phases spending time on improvements and features instead of repetitive tasks and bugs.
